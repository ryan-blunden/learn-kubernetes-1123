## Stateful Applications

---

Persisting data is a trickier than managing compute in Kubernetes.

---

PersistentVolumes (PVs) and PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) offer an abstraction over the allocation and access of storage.

---

### PersistentVolume

A PersistentVolume (PV) is storage that been provisioned by an administrator or dynamically provisioned using Storage Classes.

---

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv-volume
  labels:
    type: local
spec:
  storageClassName: manual
  capacity:
    storage: 10Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  hostPath:
    path: /data/mysql
```

---

As we're on Minikube, we'll be using `hostPath` which uses disk storage on the worker node.

---

### Access Modes

---

#### ReadWriteOnce

The volume can be mounted as read-write by a single node.

---

#### ReadOnlyMany

The volume can be mounted as read-only by many nodes.

---

#### ReadWriteMany

The volume can be mounted as read-write by many nodes.

---

### PersistentVolumeClaim

A PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is a request for storage by an resource.

---

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv-claim
spec:
  storageClassName: manual
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 2Gi
```

---

### Binding

Binding usually occurs immediately for a PersistentVolumeClaim as soon as a suitable match is found.

---

### Claims As Volumes

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: website
spec:
  containers:
    - name: website
      image: nginx
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
          name: website
  volumes:
    - name: website
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: website-claim
```
