## ConfigMaps and Secrets

---

Both can populate environment variables or be mounted as files in a container.

---

ConfigMaps and Secrets must exist prior to being referenced.

---

### Config Maps vs Secrets

ConfigMaps are (I think) are best used for mounting config files in containers.

Secrets are best for application config, even if data is not sensitive.

---

### ConfigMaps

A ConfigMap is a collection of key-value pairs created from directories, files, or literal values.

---

### Use case

Overriding the default NGINX conf without building a custom container image.

---

Because they are non-sensitive and can store values as text, they should be stored as manifests.

---

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: devjokes-nginx-conf
data:
  nginx.conf: |-
    upstream app {
        server localhost:8000;
    }

    server {
        server_name localhost;

        location / {
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
            proxy_set_header Authorization $http_authorization;
            proxy_pass http://app/;

            proxy_connect_timeout       300;
            proxy_read_timeout          300;
            client_max_body_size        1000m;
        }
    }

```

---

### Mounting ConfigMaps in a Pod

---

Step 1: Expose ConfigMap as a Volume:

```yaml
  volumes:
    - name: nginx-conf
      configMap:
        name: devjokes-nginx-conf
```

---

Step 2: Mount the ConfigMap in the Pod

```yaml
  volumeMounts:
    - name: nginx-conf
      mountPath: /etc/nginx/conf.d
```

---

### Lab

```sh
kubectl apply -f labs/nginx.conf.config-map.yaml
kubectl apply -f labs/devjokes-nginx.yaml
```

---

### Secrets

Secrets are key-value pairs designed to hold sensitive data.

---

Secrets should never be embedded directly in your Pod spec!

---

Because secret values may contain binary values (e.g. PKCS 12 certificate), they are base64 encoded.

---

This is the one resource you don't want to store in version control!

---

### Secret Types

Opaque secrets are the generic type you'll use most often.

Other types are for specific usage scenarios ( e.g. `kubernetes.io/tls`)

---

### Creating Secrets

Reddit will have systems and infrastructure in place for automating secrets sync.

---

### Create a Secret from a .env File:

```sh
kubectl create secret generic \
  mandalorian-gifs-secrets \
  --from-env-file labs/mandalorian-gifs.env
```

---

Verifying the secrets values:

```sh
kubectl get secret mandalorian-gifs-secrets -o go-template='{{range $k,$v := .data}}{{"### "}}{{$k}}{{"\n"}}{{$v|base64decode}}{{"\n\n"}}{{end}}'
```
---

### Secrets as Environment Variables

---

Can be injected selectively:

```yaml
env:
  - name: API_KEY
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: api-token
        key: API_TOKEN
```

---

Using `envFrom` is great when you're wanting to expose every secret as an environment variable:

```sh
envFrom:
    - secretRef:
        name: mandalorian-gifs-secrets
```

---

### Lab

1. Create secret from .env file contents
2. Create Alpine Pod with `command: sleep 1000` and `envFrom` for secret values
3. Verify secrets exposed as environment variables

---

### Code Challenge

Deploy the Mandalorian GIFs Python app to your Kubernetes cluster which requires a Kubernetes secret.

- Run `task  mandaloriangifs:build` to build the `mandalorian-gifs-python` image 
- The app listens on Port 8080
- Use the `labs/mandalorian-gifs.env` file to create the Kubernetes secret
- Create a Pod manifest file that uses `envFrom` to expose all secret values to the container
