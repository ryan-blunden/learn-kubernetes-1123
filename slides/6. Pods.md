## Pods

---

A Kubernetes Pod consists of one or more containers with shared storage and network resources.

---

A Pod represents an entire application or service.

---

### Pod Shared Container Resources

Containers within the same pod share the same network namespace, IP address, and storage volumes.

---

### Pod Spec

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: python-app
  labels:
    name: python-app
spec:
  containers:
    - name: python-app
      image: python-app
      run: python-app
      command: [gunicorn', 'app:app', '--bind=0.0.0.0:8000']
      ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

---

### Control Loop in Action

Force kill the NGINX Pod:

```sh
# Separate terminal
kubectl get pods --watch
```

```sh
kubectl run nginx --image nginx:alpine
eval $(minikube docker-env)
docker ps | grep nginx
docker kill CONTAINER_ID
```

---

### Pod Lifecycle

1. Pending
2. Running
3. Succeeded
4. Failed

---

### Pending

Not all containers are running yet.

---

### Running

All of the containers have been created.

---

### Succeeded

All containers in the Pod have terminated in success.

---

### Failed

All containers have the terminated but at least one container terminated in failure.

---

### Container States

1. Waiting
2. Running
3. Terminated

---

### Waiting

Still undergoing required operations before the container can be run.

---

### Running

Container is running without issues.

---

### Terminated

Either terminated in success or unexpectedly failed.

---

### Exponential Backoff

Kubernetes approach to retries.

---

### Environment Variables

Configuring your containers using environment variables.

---

### Volumes

A Container's file system lives only as long as the Container does.

---

Pod volumes allow the file system to persist for the life of the Pod, regardless of the health of any container.

---

Persisting storage beyond the life of a Pod is a more advanced topic we'll be covering later.

---

### Code Challenge 1

```
- Manually create an NGINX Pod YAML file that uses NGINX version 1.2.5
- The container port will be 80
- Use `kubectl apply` to create the pod using the YAML file
- Use `kubectl describe pod` to get details about the Pod
- Use `kubectl port-forward` to access the NGINX container on port 8080 locally
- Access NGINX at http://localhost:8080
- Stream the NGINX container logs using `kubectl logs`
- Use `minikube dashboard` to inspect the Pod's properties
```

### Code Challenge 2

- Manually create an NGINX Pod YAML file for the devjokes container image.
